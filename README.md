## Hi there 👋

I am a data scientist trained as a health economist. Over the last 10 years, I have been working 
to address persistent challenges in the development of model-based economic evaluations of 
health technologies. My goal is to ensure every model is fast, error free, and inexpensive to 
create or maintain. Currently, this is facilitated by a (private) R package which I maintian to
standardize common model development/specification and analysis tasks. 

As an R developer, I have experience with: 
- Package Development
- Object Oriented Programming
- Reproducibiltiy
- Automation
- Shiny Applications
