## Hi there 👋

I am a data scientist trained as a health economist. For the last few years, I have been
working to address persistent challenges in the development of model-based economic 
evaluations of health technologies. Every model should be fast, error free, and inexpensive
to maintain. I maintain a (private) R package to facilitate this outcome, which encourages
the standardization of common model development/specification and analysis tasks. 

As an R developer, I have experience with: 
- Package Development
- Object Oriented Programming
- Reproducibiltiy
- Automation
- Shiny Applications
